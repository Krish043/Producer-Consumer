# 🧵 Producer-Consumer Problem – Visual Simulation

[![Live Preview](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live%20Site-Visit--Now-0aa1ff?style=for-the-badge&logo=render&logoColor=white)](https://producer-consumer.onrender.com/)

A visual simulation of the classic **Producer-Consumer Problem**. This web-based project helps users understand multithreading concepts like synchronization and buffer management through an interactive interface.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates the **Producer-Consumer synchronization problem** (bounded buffer problem) using web technologies. It helps visualize how producers and consumers operate on a shared buffer and how synchronization prevents race conditions.

---

## ✨ Features

- Real-time simulation of producer and consumer actions
- Shared buffer displayed dynamically
- Adjustable buffer size and speed
- Responsive UI for better accessibility

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Deployment:** Render

---

## 🧪 How to Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Krish043/Producer-Consumer.git
cd Producer-Consumer
# Open index.html in your browser
```

## 📌 Future Scope
- Add multiple producer and consumer threads
- Visualize semaphore and mutex values
- Add detailed logs or steps display for better learning
